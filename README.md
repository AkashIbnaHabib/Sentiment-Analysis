# Sentiment-Analysis
This Project was built as a part of a course in Coursera "Python Files, Functions and Dictionaries". In this project I was provided with three csv files which I had to read and write on. I had to distinguish between positive and negative score of the tweets. Finally A net score of the positive and negative tweets were produced and also any kind of punctuations were removed.
